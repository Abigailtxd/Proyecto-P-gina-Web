PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND REPLY URGENTLY

Dear owner,

I am Mr. David Jim Brown, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service
Inspection United Nations Inspection Agency in
Harts-field-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our
investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment
through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF
Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and
when scanned it revealed an undisclosed scam

The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared
by the consignee as money rather it was declared
as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the
Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities.

The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things
are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They are
still left in the airport storage facility till today.
The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg
each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity:
680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name
and email on the official document from the United Nations' office
in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified
document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to
reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, and full address so I can
cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official
documents.
It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow
us repatriate it back to UK
(place of origin) as we were instructed.

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly
because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the
yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I
am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back
These packages provided you will also give me something out of it
(financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage
the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide
the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to
your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantees
that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.

Mr. David Jim Brown
